Short description of the one-click-annotation method. 

Look up the "demo" script.

Bullet points for successful annotation:

-Choose optimal channel.

-Choose optimal wave.
Click on the peak of the waveform you consider to be the most epileptiform with the criteria in mind.

-Check result.
A window will pop up showing the result of auto-annotation. If the spike peak hits the mark, the annotation was successful. If not, close pop-up window and try again. Click more precisely close to the peak.

-Autoannotation pop-up-window legend:
First blue mark: Spike start. 
Red mark: Peak. 
Second blue mark: Spike end and slow-wave start. 
Third blue mark: Slow-wave end.
Additionally: The green dots show other local minima considered as waveform limits, a green line showing a smoothed helping signal to find slow-wave end, and a red line showing the Gauss-fit.
